* Evidence sources to consider (offline/knowledge-based, no web calls): Alternate/Sample Titles, Occupation Definitions, Tasks, DWAs, and GWAs as conceptual guides.
* Decision flow: identify 2–3 candidate SOCs → compare against bucket scope → choose 1 code if one clearly covers ≥ ~60% → else choose 2 codes and split (0.6/0.4 or 0.5/0.5). Max 2 codes; weights sum to 1.0.
* Re-scope bucket if no candidate reaches ~50–60%.
